        <p>As a Full-Stack Web Developer, I deliver innovative, highly responsive web applications by leveraging my combined expertise in front-end technologies, back-end functional programming, and application integration. To achieve this, I deliver appealing mockups, well integrated application components, and extensive UX enhancements. 

Throughout my career I have utilized this approach to optimize user experience. During my latest project for My American Home Stay, for instance, I organized and developed a UI with high user interactivity by thoroughly researching and applying UI best practices. Meanwhile, I leveraged my strong design intuition to further increase user friendliness.   

The other key ingredient for my success is building critical back-end features. This is evident from my previous engagements, where I programmed a backbone function for Origin Flash Cards project. This drove the appâ€™s critical swipe-scoring mechanism. I achieved this by establishing my subject-matter expertise in Loopback API and defining an effective user data storage structure in the back end. 

Some of my other accomplishments include: 
- Designed highly responsive and interactive UI by implementing best practices and design templates.
- Minimized application error risk by reducing technological dependencies through custom middleware.
- Built state-of-the-art app architecture using Express, Create-React, and integrated Dev builds.
- Enabled strong user-access controls by implementing Google OAuth.
